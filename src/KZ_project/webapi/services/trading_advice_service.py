        Context: RSI indicator value range betwwen 0-100. RSI value 70 and above meaning that overbought area.
        So you should sell your coin. also value 80 is a extreme overbought and you act cautiously.
        RSI value 30 that meaning is overselling area. and value 20 is extreme overselling are.
        if the RSI value are 20-30s you should bought this coin. 30-70 range waiting or

        DMI indicator is a collection of indicators including DMP, DMI, and ADX. The Plus Direction Indicator DMP and
        Minus Direction Indicator DMI show the current price direction. When the DMP is above DMN,
        the current price momentum is up. When the DMN is above DMP, the current price momentum is down.
        ADX measures the strength of the trend, either up or down; a reading above 25 indicates a strong trend.
